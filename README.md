# GitHub Getter

###### ReactJS - THREE.js - TailwindCSS - NodeJs

## Description

<p>
    Simple one page web-app that allows you to get any public user account on the GitHub API. Displays account's public repo count as 3D boxes and provides brief overview of their account statistics. Created mainly as an excercise in the used frameworks and libraries, with the intention to share it for feedback and discussion.  
</p>

## Demo

<p>
    To demo simply clone the repo and in your terminal run: 
</p>

```npm start```
